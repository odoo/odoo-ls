# Changelog

## [1.0.1] - 2025/09/17 - Day 1 fixes

### Fixes

- Crash that can occur when doing a gotodefinition in an XML file
- Fix origin of gotodefinition for some links in XML files.
- Change back `<br/>` line breaks that sometimes break PyCharm to escaped `  \\\n`

## [1.0.0] - 2025/09/16 - Release

This project is far from finished, but it has reached a level of maturity where weâ€™re introducing two update channels: **Release** and **Pre-release** (Beta).

If you want early access to new features and to help us improve the tool, enable **Pre-release** updates in your IDE. The pre-release channel will only include features we consider ready, though crashes may still occur due to the wide variety of code we encounter. This helps us catch common issues before pushing to the stable channel.

So, if you prefer a more stable experience, stick with the **Release** channel !

Here is the changelog since the last Beta version (0.12.1)

### Zed

New plugin for Zed. As Zed API is quite poor, the implementation only stick to a basic language server implementation, and will not provide profile selector, profile viewer or crash report view.

### Server

- Change level of "unable to annotate tuple" log from error to debug, as it is indeed a debug information of non implemented statements

- Prevent creation of custom entrypoint on renaming of directory
- Handle removal of `__init__.py` from packages

- Force validation of `__iter__` functions if pending on a `for` evaluation
