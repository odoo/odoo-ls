-> change fileMgr: don't use dict, but create a True class (?), and use a dirty variable to know if we have to republish
diagnostics or not.

Odoo specificities

To check: on rebuild, if an archlevel rebuild occur, we need to trigger missing symbols validation too
-> todo: at file level, add a listener to arch rebuild? (or trigger arch_dependents?)

Bugs
=> same with file renames

=> (to check) what happen if 1 sys.path is included in another one? Are all symbols duplicated?
    We can maybe have this issue in another cases? to check and try to avoid this situation?
