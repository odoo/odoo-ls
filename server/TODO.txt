build a valid structure for hovering and go to definition
    -> basic validation (complete arch build)
        -> follow build construction and order, but validate files if an inference is needed ?
    -> data rebuild on file change
implement hover and go to definition "under cursor detetion"









Deployment
    -> add pygls and parso as python dependencies
    -> separate repositories
