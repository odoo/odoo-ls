Imports:
    Arch level:
        -> follow and import all symbols 
            -> odoo.addons... import odoo, import odoo.addons (if not already done)
            -> import sys => ignore
            -> import difflib => import it from sys.path, load symbols and drop ast (no validation)
    Validation level:
        -> follow imports to build inferences of symbols -> wrong, they should be real symbols

Odoo specificities

How to load a model? The difficulty come from the fact that everything has to be loaded to do inference and validation
of Odoo stuff, but building odoo data knowledge require to run inferences and evaluations (_inherit = _name for example)


Bugs
=> (to check) what happen if 1 sys.path is included in another one? Are all symbols duplicated?
    We can maybe have this issue in another cases? to check and try to avoid this situation?


implement hover and go to definition "under cursor detetion"



Deployment
    -> add pygls and parso as python dependencies
    -> separate repositories
