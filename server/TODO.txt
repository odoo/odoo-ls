Imports:
    Arch level:
        -> follow and import all symbols 
            -> odoo.addons... import odoo, import odoo.addons (if not already done)
            -> import sys => ignore
            -> import difflib => import it from sys.path, load symbols and drop ast (no validation)
    Validation level:
        -> follow imports to build inferences of symbols -> wrong, they should be real symbols

Bugs
=> when rebuild:
    -> if a subsymbol (of package/namespace) is not imported by parents but by validators only, they are not imported
=> (to check) what happen if 1 sys.path is included in another one? Are all symbols duplicated?
    We can maybe have this issue in another cases? to check and try to avoid this situation?


build a valid structure for hovering and go to definition
    -> basic validation (complete arch build)
        -> follow build construction and order, but validate files if an inference is needed ?
    -> data rebuild on file change
implement hover and go to definition "under cursor detetion"






Deployment
    -> add pygls and parso as python dependencies
    -> separate repositories
