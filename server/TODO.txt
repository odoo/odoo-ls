Imports:
    Arch level:
        -> follow and import all symbols 
            -> odoo.addons... import odoo, import odoo.addons (if not already done)
            -> import sys => ignore
            -> import difflib => import it from sys.path, load symbols and drop ast (no validation)
    Validation level:
        -> follow imports to build inferences of symbols -> wrong, they should be real symbols





build a valid structure for hovering and go to definition
    -> basic validation (complete arch build)
        -> follow build construction and order, but validate files if an inference is needed ?
    -> data rebuild on file change
implement hover and go to definition "under cursor detetion"


Remains for imports:
    -> add imported names as Symbol (type = ImportedVar?)
    -> for name, asname highly inefficient






Deployment
    -> add pygls and parso as python dependencies
    -> separate repositories
